# UNO Maverick's OpenAg Food Computer 2.0 - A Service Learning Project
UNO Mavericks ISQA - Build and Implementation of OpenAg Food Computer. This is the project site of the **ISQA-8086/4000 - Internet of Things, Big Data and The Cloud** class.

## Service Learning
This class is a service learning engagement project/class between University of Nebraska (UNO) and Omaha Public School's (OPS) King Science Middle School. The instructor for this class is Dr. Sachin Pawaskar (UNO) and from the OPS side is Mrs. Hollie Cotten and Mrs. Cathryn Skoumal. Please visit [OPS Student and Teacher site](docs/ops-kingscience/readme.md) for updates and progress on this project.

The Build for the Food Computer was done with significant contribution from a close friend of mine Jay Stark, who is an amazing guy when it comes to innovative building, making and future thinking.

The project would not have been possible without the significant support from the Service Learning folks at UNO's Service Learning Academy, including Julie Dierberger, Angie Carlton, among others. Please visit [Service Learning Academy site](docs/cec-sla/readme.md) for updates and progress on this project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this class and service learning engagement with OPS King Science Middle School are the following.
* Get more students especially female students involved in STEM, given that today only 27% of the scientists and engineers in the U.S. workforce are women. Hence the collaboration with Hollie/Cathryn because girl students tend to gravitate towards female teachers and have more female teachers as role models.
*	Encourage service learning for College students and tie their learning to a community engagement activity.
*	Encouraging an interest in STEM is important in K-12 schools, it is a local, state and national priority.
*	Ignite enthusiasm by making STEM learning interactive and fun.
*	Increase the level of interest in farming and agriculture in Nebraska and the US, given that only 2% of the total US population is involved in agriculture today.

## OpenAg Food Computer 2.0
The OpenAg Food Computer was build based upon the [MIT Open Agriculture Initiative](http://openag.media.mit.edu/).
