## Service Learning Academy
What is service learning? 
Service learning is a form of experiential education aimed at enhancing student learning of course material while also addressing the needs of the community through the creation and implementation of projects. These service learning projects are symbiotic in nature - they are directly linked to academic curriculum at the same time as fulfilling needs in the community, which provides collaborative experiences for students and nonprofits/governmental organizations alike.

What is the Service Learning Academy?
The UNO Service Learning Academy (SLA) facilitates collaborative partnerships between the university and the metropolitan community for the purpose of enhancing student learning, advancing community service and initiatives, and fostering engaged citizenship. The SLA was originally developed in 1999 as a university initiative within the Center for Faculty Development. The program was originally funded by a grant from the Nebraska Consortium for Service Learning in Higher Education. Today, the SLA is supported by the Office of Academic and Students Affairs. In 2006, the SLA created the P-16 Initiative to incorporate Pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade education into the service learning pedagogy. 

What is the P-16 Initiative?
The P-16 Initiative is an innovative method of service learning. P-16 stands for Pre-K through 16th grade (or seniors in college). The purpose of the P-16 Initiative is to connect PreK - 12th grade classrooms and UNO curriculum through the development of collaborative academic service learning experiences. These experiences connect learning outcomes with community-identified needs while meeting curriculum goals and course standards.

Here are a few of the photos we have taken of the Food Computer project in conjunction with UNO, OPS King Science Center Middle School, and Parallel Technologies. The students will have a final presentation in early May to report on their findings over the semester.
