# *Sensor connections to switch to I2C from UART*

I2C is a bus that allows data exchange between microcontrollers and peripherals with a minimum amount of wiring.

The pH sensor switch to I2c mode from UART is given in pages 38 and 39 of the book [Atlas Scientific Environmental Robotics V4.4](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/_files/_datasheets/_circuit/pH_EZO_datasheet.pdf)

Inorder to switch from UART to I2C,for EC sensor, refer to pages 40 and 41 of the book [Atlas Scientific Environmental Robotics V4.4](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/_files/_datasheets/_circuit/pH_EZO_datasheet.pdf)
